As a result, if the Label for the load request for `Apache Doris` (dorisDb_dorisTable_sequence_id) could be strictly aligned with the offsets from Kafka, then duplicate insertion from Kafka could be avoided. \r\n\r\nIf this feature has also been implemented in ClickHouse,too, then the data inconsistency issue could be greatly relieved. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7520","id":513797943,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTM3OTc5NDM=","number":7520,"title":"GROUP BY using WITH columns alias don't work if we call the column using the column name on SELECT","user":{"login":"YiuRULE","id":4019437,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTk0Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4019437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE","html_url":"https://github.com/YiuRULE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YiuRULE/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386401505,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzODY0MDE1MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ee0701","default":true,"description":"Confirmed user-visible misbehaviour in official release"},{"id":1507867504,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTA3ODY3NTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/labels/st-hold","name":"st-hold","color":"e5b890","default":false,"description":"We've paused the work on issue for some reason"},{"id":1507888214,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTA3ODg4MjE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/labels/st-accepted","name":"st-accepted","color":"e5b890","default":false,"description":"The issue is in our backlog, ready to take"},{"id":1842603313,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyNjAzMzEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/labels/comp-alias-columns","name":"comp-alias-columns","color":"b5bcff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-10-29T09:40:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-17T00:14:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**\r\n\r\nIf we do a `GROUP BY` using an alias column on the `WITH`, it consider the following column as not part of the `ORDER BY`\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\nClickhouse server v19.14.3\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE test (`a` UInt32, `b` UInt32) ENGINE = Memory;\r\n\r\nWITH\r\n    a as key\r\nSELECT\r\n    a as k1,\r\n    sum(b) as k2\r\nFROM\r\n    test\r\nGROUP BY\r\n    key\r\nORDER BY k1, k2;\r\n\r\nCode: 215.

described in a [documentation](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/single/#constraints-on-settings):\r\n\r\n> Note: the default profile has a special handling: all the constraints defined for the default profile become the default constraints, so they restrict all the users until they're overriden explicitly for these users.\r\n\r\nSo, i expect that i can set a `readonly` constraint for some setting for a `default` profile, then override it for some user by his profile.\r\n\r\nExample config:\r\n```\r\n<yandex>\r\n    <profiles>\r\n\r\n        <default>\r\n            <readonly>0</readonly>\r\n            <max_memory_usage>10000000000</max_memory_usage>\r\n            <constraints>\r\n                <max_memory_usage>\r\n                    <readonly/>\r\n                </max_memory_usage>\r\n            </constraints>\r\n        </default>\r\n\r\n        <developer>\r\n            <readonly>2</readonly>\r\n            <max_memory_usage>10000</max_memory_usage>\r\n            <constraints>\r\n                <max_memory_usage>\r\n                    <max>9999999999999999</max>\r\n                </max_memory_usage>\r\n            </constraints>\r\n        </developer>\r\n\r\n    </profiles>\r\n...\r\n</yandex>\r\n```\r\nWith this config i expect that i'll be able to change `max_memory_usage` for user with a profile `developer` up to `9999999999999999`, but when i try to do this, i receive following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_awesome_ch :) select * from system.settings where

The problem about partitioning is that whole partition gets attached to detached which forces users to have yet another mind-boggling decision for table design, especially if the archiving is independent of a `DateTime` column. For example, customer X has billions of data and they stop using our service, so deleting their data would save us server resources but keeping their data is a lawful obligation so we should move their data to a cold storage. Besides there is always a chance that the customer X gets back to use our service hence needs their old data. Only solution is to archive their data, so we can access it if it is needed. With partitioning, this seems not so intuitive because customers can stop using our service anytime. If `RETURNING` expression would be possible, we could insert deleted data to a remote database which is served on a cold storage and used for archive.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO remote('archive_server', 'default', 'customer')\r\n   DELETE FROM customer\r\n   WHERE cust_id = 123\r\n   RETURNING *;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know table mutations are not instant so implementing `RETURNING`  expression for INSERT and UPDATE/DELETE will be different but this would be a nice feature since it is only an SQL and it doesn't need to SSH into server to move detached partitions manually.\r\n\r\n**Use case 3**: Trigger*ish* behaviour.\r\nCombining with [URL table engine](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/operations/table_engines/url/), `RETURNING` expression can be used to send modified data to an URL. So an application running on the target URL can act as body of an INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE trigger.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE customer_delete_trigger (cust_id UInt64)\r\n    ENGINE=URL('http://127.0.0.1:12345/customer/delete', CSV)\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO customer_delete_trigger\r\n    DELETE FROM customer WHERE cust_id = 123\r\n    RETURNING cust_id\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7195","id":502559789,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDI1NTk3ODk=","number":7195,"title":"Data not insert to MATERIALIZED created from another MATERIALIZED VIEW ","user":{"login":"Kiennh","id":6395999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6395999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh","html_url":"https://github.com/Kiennh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kiennh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":785082162,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODUwODIxNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/labels/comp-documentation","name":"comp-documentation","color":"b5bcff","default":false,"description":"Used to run automatic builds of the documentation"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2019-10-04T10:32:58Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T02:18:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**\r\nWhen I create MATERIALIZED view from another MATERIALIZED view, data not auto insert from the first view to the second view.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\nCreate table and the views:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE a1(label String) ENGINE=Log ;   \r\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW a2 engine=Log as select * from a1; \r\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW a3 engine=Log as select * from a2;\r\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW a4 engine=Log as select * from a3;\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsert data into the table a1:\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO a1 values('1');   \r\n```\r\n\r\nTest the result\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM a2\r\n\r\n┌─label─┐\r\n│ 1     │\r\n└───────┘\r\n\r\n1 rows in set.

Instead it looks like it tries to read the whole location column and slows down the query around 8 times. I've also tried with argMax() instead of `order by x limit 1` but it seems to suffer from the same issue.\r\n\r\nOriginally I also had a join to `repositories` in there, but that did not change the performance of either query so I've removed it in the interest of a more minimal reproducer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7187/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7102","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7102/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7102/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7102/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/7102","id":498574006,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTg1NzQwMDY=","number":7102,"title":"optimize_read_in_order

Using that one could enforce absence of some event (condition) in the chain of events.\r\nMaybe there should be alternate version with `(!?N)` positioned outside of match pattern to express condition \"this event never happened in given event chain regardless of other events\".\r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\nUsing `arrayExists`.

with the excellent performance of Clickhouse on single machine, the distributed infrastructure could be improved as well due to these issues:\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\nAlthough ReplicationMergetree provides the mechanism for high availability, it has some shortcomings: The burden of Zookeeper is too heavy, and could become the bottleneck if the write throughput is high, because too much data is written through ZK. Could such mechanism as replication state machine be used for replica management?\r\n\r\n### Rebalance\r\nClickhouse does not support auto rebalance right now, which makes it inconvenient for cluster's scaling up or scaling down, or fault tolerance, this is not friendly to operations. A simple idea is to have data partition managed by a seperate component to be able to be transfered across nodes automatically, just like Apache Doris, EventQL, or some NewSQL database as TiDB, Cockcroach have done.\r\n\r\n### Transactions\r\nGuarantee ACID is unnecessary for OLAP, however, there exist many situations where data durability is required, such as the so called `exactly once computing`. For example, if we need exactly once semantic exist within the ETL job which sinks data to Clickhouse, the transactional API is very useful to `end-to-end exactly once`, working together with such components as Flink or Kafka Transactional API. Similar OLAP solutions as Apache Doris has already supported such issue in its `stream load` feature.\r\n\r\n### Resource Isolation\r\nCorresponding feature could be seen at [Doris' site](https://doris.apache.org/).\r\n\r\nIt seems that if the pros of both Clickhouse and Doris could be combined, then there would be a `perfect` OLAP solution. Does there exist any roadmap for such evolution?

Clickhouse Team,\r\n\r\nIvan suggested I deposit this suggestion here. My suggestion is to implement sas7bdat support. Lots of enterprise and academic datasets are stored in SAS format. Enterprise customers looking to migrate would need to convert SAS directly.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion** Similar to Parquet support, SAS support would be nice. It would be nice to not have to specify the file format similar to importing a CSV - e.g. I think SAS files are self-describing from which Clickhouse could generate a schema. I think the Java Parso library could help you get started implementing this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6159","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6159/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6159/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6159/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/6159","id":472980091,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzI5ODAwOTE=","number":6159,"title":"Update and delete","user":{"login":"Sundarcj","id":29049117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDQ5MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29049117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj","html_url":"https://github.com/Sundarcj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sundarcj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386401510,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzODY0MDE1MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/labels/question","name":"question","color":"bfdadc","default":true,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-07-25T17:18:26Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T23:42:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi,\r\n   I am having a use case of processing trillions of records. where I can't predict what type of data we are about to process .. kind of data cleaning tool.so can I go with the distributed engine to utilize the parallel query processing.? or with single node?.

situation**\r\nCurrently, SQL functions performs validation of given arguments inside their body. During validation, there are common error situations (illegal types of arguments, number of arguments does not match, etc.). Currently, error messages for such cases are formed in each function separately, and it has following circumstances:\r\n\r\n1. In each function implementation file, we are adding section ErrorCodes with code constants\r\n2. Copy-pasted creation of exception messages (toString(xxx), etc)\r\n3. Messages sometimes drops useful context (position of argument, given type and expected type)\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\nI propose to unify messages for arguments validation, in following manner:\r\nWrong number of variadic arguments\r\n`Function {function_name} expects {start} - {end} arguments, {given_number_of_arguments} given`\r\nVariadic function called without arguments\r\n`Function {function_name} expects at least one argument, but none given`\r\nToo much arguments for variadic function\r\n`Function {function_name} expects at most {max_arguments}, but {given_count} given`\r\n\r\nValidating types of arguments:\r\n```\r\nIllegal type {given_type} of {position} argument for function {function_name}\r\nIllegal type {given_type} of {position} argument for function {function_name} - must be {expected_type}\r\nIllegal type {given_type} of {position} argument for function {function_name} - must be {expected_type1} or {expected_type2} or {expected_type3}\r\n```\r\n(within implementation, {position} can be human-friendly for first 9 positions:\r\n`Illegal type UInt16 of third argument for function multiIf`)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFrom my point of view, it would be good to implement several DB::Exception sub-classes with appropriate constructors.

one internal part of Yandex Banner System, there is a practice to manually rewrite queries like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n    key1, ... keyN,\r\n    agg1(args), ..., aggM(args)\r\nFROM table\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY key1, ... keyN\r\nORDER BY key1, ... keyN\r\nLIMIT a, b\r\n```\r\n\r\n(note that there are multiple aggregate functions \r\nbut result is sorted and paginated only by

the calculation of `agg1(args), ..., aggM(args)` for the keys that are not within `LIMIT a, b`\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature is to avoid the need for manual optimization by either:\r\n- implementing this optimization by query (or pipeline) rewrite inside ClickHouse;\r\n- implementing incremental partial sorting inside Aggregator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5329/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}]
